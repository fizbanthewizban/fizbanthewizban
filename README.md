- 👋 Hi, I’m @fizbanthewizban
- 👀 I’m mainly interested in learning how to create video games, but I am incredibly open to learning skills outside of this.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a multitude of things, but in terms of coding, I have been learning how to code games in GameMaker 2 Studio.
- 💞️ I am not very experienced, but would love to collaborate where I can and I look forward to taking in as much knowledge as I can here.
- 📫 Nowhere to reach me yet, besides perhaps on this site.
